### My Video Game History
The first video game I can remember playing is *Super Mario Brothers* on the NES when I was 8 years old. I was captivated by it and spent hours playing. I can remember the feeling I would get when I would make it to the end of a world because, with that game, if you died, you had to start all the way back at the beginning. I then moved on to playing *Spyro*, *Crash Bandicoot*, and the first Harry Potter games that were released. 

At some point, though, I stopped playing video games and started other hobbies. It wasn't until I was 18 that I rediscovered my love for them. I played the *Elder Scrolls Oblivion* on PS3 and I was addicted. Since then, I have steadily increased the games I play and found a few that are my favorite. 

My all time **favorite** game series has been [*Assassin's Creed*](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/). I really enjoy the stealth aspect of the game along with the story. I have played all the ones that have been released for console. However, I have not been a huge fun of the recent two, *Assassin's Creed Odyssey* and *Assassin's Creed Origins*, just because I feel they have stepped away from the orginal plot, and made the fighting engine more of a hack and slash rather than being about stealth (e.g. needing to take out one person without getting caught). 

Other games that I go back and forth between are [*The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim*](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim), [*The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion*](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion), [The *Fallout* Series](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/), [*The Sims*](https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims), and [*Borderlands*](https://borderlands.com/en-US/).
