I grew up in the bootheel of Missouri in a small town by the name of Steele. While I grew up in Missouri, I am originally from Mississippi, so I have a pretty strong southern accent that has shaped me. For more informtion on my journey with that check out my page [Language that Shaped Me.](LanguageThatShapedMe.md)

 After high school, I moved to Springfield, MO and started school at Ozarks Technical Community College. After two years attending OTC, I got the opportunity to move to Seattle, however, I wanted to continue my education with a Missouri college so I enrolled as a distance student with the University of Missouri majoring in Information Technology.
