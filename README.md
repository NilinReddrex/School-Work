I grew up in a small town in the 'bootheel' of Missouri by the name of _Steele_. While I grew up in Missouri, I am originally from Mississippi, so I have a pretty strong southern accent that has shaped me. For more information on my journey with that, check out my page [Language that Shaped Me.](LanguageThatShapedMe.md)

 After high school, I moved to Springfield, MO. and started school at Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC). After two years attending OTC, I got the opportunity to move to Seattle, however, I wanted to continue my education with a Missouri college, so I enrolled as a distance student with the University of Missouri majoring in Information Technology.
